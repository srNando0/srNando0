## Summary

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UFRJ and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Graphics at PUC-Rio. I've been studying, for years, fields such as computer graphics, numerical methods, collision detection, low-complexity algorithms, and cryptography. Here are some of the main topics I'm studying the most:

- Computer Graphics: post-processing, tone mapping, real-time ray tracing, realistic rendering.
- Numerical Methods: methods for ODE and PDE, high order Runge-Kutta methods, finite element method, convexity-based methods, computational geometry, optimization.
- Low Complexity Algorithms: Cooleyâ€“Tukey FFT algorithm, all sorts of collision detection algorithms, state-of-the-art data structures.
- Cryptography: RSA, ElGamal, elliptic curves, Schnorr signature, modular arithmetic algorithms, Montgomery arithmetic, mental poker.

My dream job would be one in which I could use all my potential and knowledge of low-complexity algorithms and numerical methods in the development of some important software. Some examples would be working on a real-time realistic renderer, for physics simulation, or working on some interesting and challenging problem for software development.
